# imapxDocumentation
The old CodePlex documenation (status as of December 2017) of the ImapX project (https://github.com/azanov/imapx)


This repository only remains as long as the original project documentation is not migrated to its Github repository.


# HowTo
Just download the repository and open the documentation.html in the browser of your choice. Each wiki-page is linked, so the html files should remain in the same folder.
